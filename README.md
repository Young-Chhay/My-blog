## Goal of this Project 
* Utilize Moment.Js to display current day and time for User. 
* Add code to HTML to create Timeblocks, buttons and Textarea while applying classes and ID. 
* write code to apply each styling for time that is in the past, the present and the future using Moment.Js so user can easily adjust their task. 
* use Eventlistener to listen for Save button when click and store user input into local storage using setItem. 
* Use document.ready and localStorage to pull each time block data that were saved and append content to respective time blocks in the page.

* Reorganize the page structure to follow semantic structure of the HTML elements
* Deployed Page to Github. 
> I spend most of the time working on setting up Javascript logic while also utilizing bootstrapper for easier styling. I had some issue with storing user input when navigating the DOM. It was took alot of time to go through at first but after researching and reviewing on class Material, the logic became more clear and I was able to apply the concept and made it work.
